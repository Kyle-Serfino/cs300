What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

One of the problems that I came across while taking this class and working on this project was understanding the material and when to use it. What I mean by this is there were all these options that were presented and through my own research. Having to understand these new topics was really fun and challenging but having this be an online class meant most communication was through email which sometimes can take too long to be able to find out the fix or reason for what the issue can be.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The fix to most of my problems was using my resources to their fullest extent. That includes things like google, note review and asking people who are in the field to break down topics and help me get a better grasp on them. These topics are important to understand because having good data control and building these problem solving skills are crucial to succeed in this field.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Added these resources to my skill repertoire has made me look at past projects and understand that I can now go back and edit them to run much smoother and without problems. With this project now I can go back and look at this project in the future and add this as a resource for issues that might appear in the future. Learning these new skill will defiantly make future projects a alot easier to read and edit if I choose to go back to them.
